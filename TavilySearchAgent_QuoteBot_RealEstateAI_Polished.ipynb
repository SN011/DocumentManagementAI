You can use the `@traceable` decorator to auto-trace your LLM calls.\\n2. **Evaluation**: LangSmith provides an evaluation framework that allows you to test your LLM applications with your own data and evaluators. You can define your own evaluators to score the results of your LLM application.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you can use LangSmith to evaluate your LLM application:\\n```python\\nfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom langsmith.evaluation import evaluate\\n\\n# Define your dataset\\ndataset_name = \"Sample Dataset\"\\ndataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name, description=\"A sample dataset in LangSmith.\")\\nclient.create_examples(\\n    inputs=[{\"postfix\": \"to LangSmith\"}, {\"postfix\": \"to Evaluations in LangSmith\"}],\\n    outputs=[{\"output\": \"Welcome to LangSmith\"}, {\"output\": \"Welcome to Evaluations in LangSmith\"}],\\n    dataset_id=dataset.id,\\n)\\n\\n# Define your evaluator\\ndef exact_match(run, example):\\n    return {\"score\": run.outputs[\"output\"] == example.outputs[\"output\"]}\\n\\n# Evaluate your LLM application\\nexperiment_results = evaluate(\\n    lambda input: \"Welcome \" + input[\\'postfix\\'],  # Your LLM application goes here\\n    data=dataset_name,\\n    evaluators=[exact_match],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"sample-experiment\",\\n    metadata={\"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"revision_id\": \"beta\"}\\n)\\n```\\nThis code defines a dataset, creates examples, defines an evaluator, and evaluates the LLM application using the `evaluate` function.\\n\\nLangSmith provides more features and guides to help you test and evaluate your LLM applications.'}"
