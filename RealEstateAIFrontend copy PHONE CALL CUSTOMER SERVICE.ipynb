Sure, I'll provide detailed answers to each question in the questionnaire to ensure no further questions are needed.  Initial Inquiry and Information Gathering:  Type of HVAC service needed: I need a complete installation of a new HVAC system. The current system is old and inefficient, so I'm looking to upgrade to a more modern, energy-efficient model. Current HVAC system make and model: The current system installed in my home is a Trane XR13. It has served well for many years but is now showing signs of wear and reduced efficiency. Specific issues or symptoms: The system struggles to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the house, making it uncomfortable, especially during extreme weather conditions. Additionally, it produces unusual noises which suggest mechanical issues, and my energy bills have increased significantly, indicating that the system is no longer operating efficiently. Property Details:  Address: The property is located at 13599 Cobra Dr, Herndon, VA 20171. Type of property: This is a residential property. Age and current condition of the property: The property is 15 years old. It is in fair condition but has not undergone any major upgrades or renovations recently, particularly concerning the HVAC system. Size of the home: The house is approximately 2500 square feet in size. Number of rooms and their usage: The house comprises 10 rooms, including a living room, an office, four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a kitchen. System Details:  Age and efficiency rating of the existing HVAC system: The Trane XR13 system currently in place is 15 years old. When it was installed, it had a SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rating of 13. This rating is now considered low compared to modern systems, which typically have SEER ratings of 16 or higher. Any known problems with the current system: The system has several issues: it struggles to maintain consistent temperatures, makes unusual noises, and has led to significantly higher energy bills. Recent changes to the HVAC system: There have been no recent changes, upgrades, or repairs to the HVAC system. All components, including the ductwork and thermostat, are original and have not been modified or updated. Home Characteristics:  Insulation quality and window types: The house has standard insulation, which is adequate but not optimal. The windows are double-pane, providing reasonable insulation but not the highest energy efficiency available with newer window technologies. Unique architectural features: There are no unique architectural features that would significantly affect the HVAC installation. Customer Preferences:  Preferences for specific brands, energy efficiency levels, or additional features: I am interested in brands that offer long warranties and have a strong reputation for reliability. Excellent customer support is a must. I also prefer systems that are highly energy-efficient and come with advanced features like smart thermostats and air purifiers to improve indoor air quality. Level of finishes desired: I am looking for premium finishes that provide durability and aesthetic appeal while ensuring the system's efficiency and functionality. Budget:  Budget range for the project: The budget for this project is between $10,000 and $15,000. I am willing to consider a slightly higher cost if it ensures better quality and longer-term benefits. Any flexibility within the budget: There is some flexibility in the budget to accommodate higher-quality options or additional features that offer significant long-term benefits. Timeline:  Desired start date and completion date: I would like the project to start within the next month and be completed within two weeks from the start date to minimize disruption. Any constraints or deadlines: There are no specific constraints or deadlines, but the sooner the project is completed, the better.
